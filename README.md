# ðŸ“Š Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse & Analytics Project** repository ðŸš€  
This portfolio project showcases the full journey of creating a modern data warehouse and building analytical solutions on top of it. From integrating raw data sources to generating actionable insights, the aim is to demonstrate industry-standard practices in **data engineering** and **data analytics**.

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview

### Data Engineering: Building the Warehouse
The first phase focuses on consolidating data using SQL Server to establish a reliable warehouse environment. The goals are:

- **Data Ingestion**: Import datasets from two systems (ERP and CRM) delivered in CSV format.  
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse, standardise and resolve inconsistencies before further analysis.  
- **Integration**: Merge both sources into a single, analysis-friendly model optimised for querying.  
- **Scope**: Work with the latest available dataset (no requirement for historisation at this stage).  
- **Documentation**: Provide clear, well-structured documentation to support both business and analytics users.

### Data Analytics: BI & Reporting
Once the warehouse is built, SQL-driven analytics are developed to provide deeper insights into key areas:

- **Customer Behaviour** â€“ Understanding how customers interact and engage.  
- **Product Performance** â€“ Assessing product sales, strengths, and opportunities.  
- **Sales Trends** â€“ Identifying changes and emerging patterns over time.
